## 📖 My Learning Experience
Building this project was actually super fun.  
The hardest part was syncing the flashing colors with proper delays — I had to figure out `setTimeout` usage correctly.  
At first, my game skipped colors unexpectedly, but after debugging, it now works smoothly.  
This project really helped me understand DOM events and timing in JavaScript.
